ANTLER OUTFITTERS WAS FOUNDED IN 2010\. IT WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE A DREAM. A DREAM ABOUT DOING WHAT WE LOVE. SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND SHOWING WHAT HARD WORK AND REAL ETHICAL HUNTING IS ALL ABOUT.
We don't hunt high fences and we do not own big game ranches. For the most part, we are hunting local farms, public property, or leased and managed land.
We are every day blue collar guys that work hard scouting, planning, hanging stands and managing wildlife. If you are a die hard hunter and hunt the same ground as 9 other guys, then you know how hard you have to work. You don't have the pick of 10 mature 150" plus deer. You are going to get one shot at a good deer that might only be 130-140 inches. That's the reality of public land or the nice old lady down the roads property.
Whether it's hooking perch, walleye or bass, chasing big turkey's, launching a few rounds at upland game or, stalking whitetails... we are always looking for the next heart pumping adventure, or a quiet sit in a tree, just admiring god's creation.
